# Surveillance Robot with Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision

## Overview

This project aims to build a surveillance robot using Raspberry Pi and computer vision technology to monitor areas where human access is limited or not feasible. The robot is equipped with a Raspberry Pi microcontroller and a camera, allowing it to stream video over Wi-Fi and perform basic image and video operations using OpenCV. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) concepts, the robot can be controlled remotely via a laptop or mobile device, thereby extending its range of operation.
